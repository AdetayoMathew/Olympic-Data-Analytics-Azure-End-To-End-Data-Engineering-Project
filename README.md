# PROJECT BRIEF
In this data engineering project, I leveraged Microsoft Azure Data Factory to establish a seamless data pipeline, sourcing data from my GitHub repository. Utilizing PySpark for data transformation, I processed the retrieved data before storing both the raw and transformed datasets in Azure Data Lake. This structured approach enables subsequent analysis within Azure Synapse Analytics, facilitating insightful exploration and interpretation of the data.
